# Smart Mass Lighting
Mass Lighting is an integral part of human life, both urban and rural. While in rural spaces this is mostly limited to public spaces like street lighting, in urban areas there are lots of private installations as well.

## Self-Healing Self-Organising Mesh Network
For purposes of our project, we will define these as network of lights ranging from 50 to 1000 in one cluster. For larger installations, we can create a network of multiple clusters. This network has to be self-discovering, self-healing and self-organising in order to achieve the scale and flexibility in a project of this nature.

## Improve Efficiency, Prevent Loss
Improving efficiency and reducing wastage in this space is critical because of how wide-spread these solutions are. The potential scale of loss due to lack of efficiency and undetected wastage is significant.

Nearly 8 Terra Watt Hours of energy is used for street-lighting in India. Just by optimising the switch on-off times by aligning it to sunrise/sunset, we can save nearly 12.5% of this energy (1 Terra Watt). Idukki IHEP has an average annual production capacity of 2500 MWh on average. This means what we can potentially save equals what 400 IHEPs can produce.

Also, we can save on CapEx as the bulb life gets extended to more days due to better regulated daily usage.

## Current Status
We have done the initial stage here where below features are built
- Mesh Network & Self-Discovery
- Logical Grouping of Lights
- Controlling at node and group levels

## Future
We are yet to build the following
- Self-Healing
- Biomimicry (ant-colony) for coordination
- Efficiency improvement with AI

Here is a short video we did while working.
